<h1>About me</h1>
<h2>Jay Kit Foong</h2>
<p>Hello everyone, my name is Jay Kit Foong and I am currently taking the Computer information technology program at BCIT. I have an interest in how computers work and interact with each another. Ever since I was young, computers have always intrigued me. I spend most of my time on the computer; whether it be to surf the web, talk to friends and family, read atricles, or to watch Netflix, I enjoy every second of it. The world today revolves around the computer because of the unlimited things you can do with it. In my spare time, I <em>love</em> playing video games on my computer. For all these reasons, I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge about computers thus focusing all my attention on<b> Computer information technology.</b></p>
